# PURPL
Constructing your own lab
Lab Description 
Ovarian cancers are very treatable forms of cancer when caught early on. However, due to the lack of early detection methods, most tumors are not caught until later stages. The PURPL gene is located on Chromosome 5: 27,217,714-27,497,871. This gene codes for the upregulation of tumor suppressor gene p53. P53 received signals of DNA damage or stress, either for cell cycle arrest to repair damaged DNA or promote apoptosis. In cancers, p53 is often mutated so that it is inactivated, allowing the cell cycle to continue unregulated. By comparing the Dan structure chromosome 5 to SRAs of ovarian tumors, we can see how common alterations in the PURPL gene are, and what regions of the gene are mutated.
